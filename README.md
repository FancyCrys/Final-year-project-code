# 🚦 Smart AI Traffic Control System

A low-cost, Raspberry Pi–based intelligent traffic light controller using real-time computer vision and adaptive logic to optimize vehicle flow at intersections.

Built with Python, OpenCV, and RPi.GPIO — this project is a proof-of-concept for smarter, scalable urban mobility systems using embedded hardware.

##  Features

- 🚗 Detects vehicles in 3 separate lanes using a PiCamera
- 🧠 Dynamically adjusts green light duration based on real-time traffic density
- 💡 Simulates traffic signals using LEDs connected to GPIO pins
- 📷 Lightweight image processing using OpenCV (no ML model required)
- ⚙️ Runs fully offline – ideal for remote, low-resource environments
